In fact, the US Census Bureau states **_the average American moves 11.7 times in their lifetime_** ([Calculating Migration Expectancy Using ACS Data](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/guidance/calculating-migration-expectancy.html)). That is a lot of moving! The annual percentage of Americans who move is 11.2% ([American Moving & Storage Association](https://www.moving.org/newsroom/data-research/about-our-industry/)). \n\nOne reason people don't enjoy moving is likely due to the cost associated with it. <br>\n<br>**_How much does moving cost?_**\n1. Average cost for an interstate move is **_4,100 dollars_**\n2. Average cost for an in-state move is **_980 dollars_**\n3. Each local mover hired charges, on average, **_25 dollars per hour_**.<br>\n*([Based on moveBuddha's Moving Cost Calculator](https://www.movebuddha.com/moving-cost-calculator/))*"

            "source": "## 1.2 Problem\nWhile we may not be able to completely avoid moving, we may be able to limit the times we move by **moving smarter**. Many movers stay in the same state and tend to not go very far at all, 40.2% of all movers relocated less than 50 miles from their old home to their new one\n([Mover\u2019s Remorse](https://porch.com/resource/movers-remorse)). It is my assumption that many of these people moving are realizing the neighborhood/area they were in was not ideal and they desire some change in location and/or access to local venues. \n\nThe problem I intend to address through this data analysis is to eliminate some of the reasons people tend to relocate to help people **move smarter**. The US Census question from 2015-2016 surveyed Americans as to why they moved ([US Census Questionnaire](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/guidance/calculating-migration-expectancy.html)), I will build upon their research to provide a model to help prospective moving families choose a neighborhood that will meet their desires/needs to ensure greater longevity in their new house. \n\nFor this model these are the concerns listed in the US Census Questionnaire I will attempt to curve/address: <br>\n- Wanted new or better home/apartment \u2014 17.4% <br>\n- New job or transfer \u2014 10.8% <br>\n- Other family reason \u2014 10.5% <br>\n- Wanted to own a home, not rent \u2014 5.9% <br>\n- Wanted better neighborhood/less crime \u2014 3.1% <br>\n\nIn order to give the model more purpose I will create a family profile with desires for their new home to better tailor the results to address the above listed concerns. The family I am profiling is a family of four with two young children. There preferences in a new home are listed in the table below.\n<br>\n\n   | Family Profile    | Desires/Wants    |\n   | :---------------- |:----------------:|\n   | 1st Preference    | Family-Friendly  |\n   | 2nd Preference    | Safe / Low Crime |\n   | 3rd Preference    | Good Schools     |\n   | Desired City      | Chicago          |"

            "source": "## 1.3 Interest\nI think that this model will have a lot of interest from the masses, with such a high number of people often moving it could address a common problem people face. My goal is to address several of the concerns above by creating a model that allows for **moving smarter**. This will help to limit those who have chosen to move because they *wanted new or better home/apartment 17.4%*, *other family reason 10.5%*, *wanted to own a home, not rent*, and/or *wanted a better neighborhood/less crime 3.1%*. While none of those reasons can be completely eliminated, especially with change over time, a better way of finding a great place to live may alleviate the need to move so often. \n\nAccording to the survey 10.8% of people said they moved due to a new job or transfer, however, the [American Moving & Storage Association](https://www.moving.org/newsroom/data-research/about-our-industry/) states that number is closer to 38% of those who move. This leads me to believe there may be interest from these corporations because if they can help in the relocation process and better ensure their relocated employees settle in, it allows the employee to focus with higher morale on the profession.\n\nLastly, I believe this could be a good tool for real estate agents and companies because the ability to give more personalized suggestions to prospective buyers may allow for quicker closings and greater customer relationships."
